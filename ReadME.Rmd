This project uses data from the National Emissions Inventory (NEI) database, 
released by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which reports the number 
of tons of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emitted by a given source over the 
course of a given year. This assignment focuses in particular on data for 1999, 
2002, 2005, and 2008.
