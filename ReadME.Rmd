This project uses data from the National Emissions Inventory (NEI) database, 
released by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which reports the number 
of tons of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emitted by a given source over the 
course of a given year. This assignment focuses in particular on data for 1999, 
2002, 2005, and 2008.

##Loading and pre-processing data
The data was downloaded and unzipped.

The data itself is located in summarySCC_PM25.rds.

The codebook for the data is locaed in Source_Classification_Code.rds.

The files were read into r using readRDS().

The plots and r codes for each plot are saved as six separate files, one for each question. Each r file contains code to read the data in, although the data was only read in once for the purpose of the actual assignment.
